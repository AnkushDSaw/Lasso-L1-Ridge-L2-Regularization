# Lasso-L1-Ridge-L2-Regularization
Lasso(L1) &amp; Ridge(L2) Regularization
# regularization
When we have more attributes with high coefficients that time our model face the problem of Overfitting.
To overcome this problem we have regularization techniues
# Lasso-L1-Regularization
R= Loss+ (alpha)||W||, Here ||W||=w1+w2+w3...
# Ridge-L2-Regularization
R= Loss+ (alpha)||W||2, Here ||W|| square =w12+w22+w32...
# Aim - Scale data and apply Linear, Ridge & Lasso Regression with Regularization
